Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) and his diverse, lovable colleagues as they police the NYPD's 99th Precinct. After Capt. Raymond Holt's (Andre Braugher) demotion to patrolman at the end of Season 6, the squad's world is turned upside down. Rounding out the ensemble is the newly promoted Lt. Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews). Reporting to him is Sgt. Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero), a consummate rule-follower with a weak spot for dork dancing and her husband, Jake. The other detectives in the squad include Jake's best friend, Det. Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio), and the tough-as-nails Det. Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz). Also part of the Nine-Nine are veteran officers Det. Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller) and Det. Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker), whose only skill as police officers is their ability to make a passable pot of coffee.\n\nCool cool cool.
